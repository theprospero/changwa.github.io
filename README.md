I am an Assistant professor at ESCP Business School.

My research seeks to understand how social evaluations determine the relationships between firms and societies. More particularly, for instance, I study how employees’ legitimacy judgments influence firms implementing a corporate purpose and CSR/sustainability practices. In other projects, I study the moral and affective dimension of social evaluations on firm performance.

My research relies on experiments, panel data, and conceptual approaches. I integrate both practical lines of questioning from my experience as an HR Director ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/changwahuynh/)) and my theoretical backgrounds in philosophy (MA in Philosophy – [University Paris X](https://dep-philo.parisnanterre.fr/)), mathematics (Master in mathematics – [University Paris VI](http://www.ufrmath.upmc.fr/en/index.html)), law (LLM in Labor Law – [University Paris II](https://www.u-paris2.fr/fr)), and management (Ph.D. & Master in Management – [HEC Paris](https://www.hec.edu/)).

*Research areas: Strategic Human Capital, Legitimacy judgments, Institutional Theory, Purpose, Corporate Social Responsibility, Morality, Prosocial motivation, Emotions*
